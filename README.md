_*This repository contains the codebase for the Advanced Software Engineering Coursework project._

The Coffee Shop Simulation project is designed to simulate the opening, operation, and growth of a coffee shop through the development of a software system. The project focuses on creating a functional and efficient system that models key processes such as order management, item inventory, customer interactions, and business operations. The team responsible for this project is made up of five members, each contributing to different aspects of the development process, ranging from system design and implementation to testing and version control.

### Features
* Order Management: Create, update, and remove orders.
* Item Management: Add and remove items from an order.
* Discount Functionality: Apply discounts to orders.
* Exception Handling: Custom exceptions to handle invalid orders, items, and operations.
* Order List Management: Maintain a list of orders and manage them efficiently.
